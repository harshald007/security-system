# Security-System
## Project Overview:

1) A C++-based console application designed to manage and securely store user passwords.
2) Provides a range of functionalities like storing, updating, and retrieving passwords with encryption.
3) Implements file handling to store password data securely in an encrypted format.

## Project Overview:

1) **Secure Password Storage**: Safely store multiple passwords for different accounts with encryption to protect sensitive data.
2) **Add New Password**: Users can add passwords for different accounts like email, banking, and social media.
3) **Update Existing Passwords**: Allows users to update existing passwords when required.
4) **Retrieve Passwords**: View stored passwords securely, only accessible with a master password.
5) **Delete Passwords**: Option to remove passwords from the system when no longer needed.
6) **Password Encryption**: Ensures all passwords are stored in an encrypted form using C++ encryption techniques to prevent unauthorized access.
7) **Master Password Authentication**: A master password is required to access, add, or retrieve any password, adding an extra layer of security.

## Technologies Used:
   - **C++**: Core language for building the system.
   - **File Handling**: Used to store and retrieve passwords from external files.
   - **Basic Encryption**: Simple encryption techniques (e.g., Caesar cipher) to secure stored passwords.
   - **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**: C++ OOP concepts like classes and objects are used to modularize the code.

## How to Run:
1) Clone the repository: git clone <repo-link>
2) Open the project in any C++ IDE (e.g., Code::Blocks, Visual Studio) or compile using the command line.
3) Build the project and run the executable.
4) On first run, set up a **master password** for access.
5) Use the system to store, retrieve, update, or delete passwords.

## File Structure:
- **passwords.txt**: Stores encrypted passwords.
- **main.cpp**: The core logic of the password management system.
  
## Future Enhancements:
- Implement **stronger encryption algorithms** (e.g., AES or hashing).
- Add a **GUI interface** for a more user-friendly experience.
- Implement **password strength checker** during password creation.
- Integrate with **password generation** tools for secure random password creation.
